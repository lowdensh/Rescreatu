Hi, USERNAME! How are you? :)


Previous Work

To start off, here's some profiles I have made which you can look at as examples of what I can do and for some ideas:
http://www.rescreatu.com/profile.php?username=River
http://www.rescreatu.com/profile.php?username=Shinohara
http://www.rescreatu.com/profile.php?username=Quellsrule
http://www.rescreatu.com/profile.php?username=Jess
http://www.rescreatu.com/profile.php?username=Lilith

What I am able to code isn't restricted to what you see above. All you need to do is ask. :) Basic diagrams are very helpful if you have a specific idea.

I'll be continually showing you the profile as I work, adding/removing/tweaking based on your comments. I'll keep making changes as we go until you love the result.


Colours and Theme

Let me know what colours you have in mind for your profile, or if there's a certain theme you'd like to base it on.

What type of colours were you thinking - pastel, bright, dark..? I can choose colour palletes for you if you prefer that (just let me know where to start).


Modules

In your profile preferences, the following modules can be easily enabled/disabled: Wish List, Trophies, Collections, Friends, Comments, Awards

The module you can't disable is the one with your account details (Last Seen, Gender etc.). I can hide this for you if you want, or even hide specific rows (see my profile for an example).


Site-Wide Modules

Do you want the Rescreatu logo, navigation, side panel etc. to be hidden or kept visible?


Extras

Let me know any other details you can think of. For example, rounded/pointed corners? Content alignment?

For fonts, you can stick to default or pick any from here: https://fonts.google.com/ (specify where the font should be used)


Lastly...

Thanks for reading my novel ;) I know that's a lot of info, but when it comes down to commissions I really want to create something that's exactly what you want. And as mentioned before, I'll be asking you to look at your profile before I do the handover, so if you aren't happy with anything I'll can keep making reasonable modifications until you are.

My price for profile coding commissions is 40m TU. This may be raised based on the complexity and scale of your request. If what you want is quite basic I will lower this price.
