<div id="poem">
  <p class="line">Sometimes, everything works out perfectly.</p>
  <p class="line">It isn't easy, being the different one, being the one that everybody expects to save the world.</p>
  <p class="line">But. But.</p>
  <p class="line">Someone has to. And if it's me? Well then. <i>Somebody has to</i></p>
  <p class="line">I just wish it didn't end up with others in the firing line.</p>
  <p class="line">But then that's the thing. I want to protect everybody around me. But that doesn't always happen.</p>
  <p class="line">Every injury, every death, is a weight on my soul that feels too heavy to bear.</p>
  <p class="line">But if I don't remember them, nobody will.</p>
  <p class="line">It doesn't matter how good I am. If people get hurt? <b>I have to be better.</b></p>
  <p class="line">And so, I will be.</p>
  <p class="line">For every soul lost because of things I did, things I didn't, everything I could not prevent?</p>
  <p class="line"><i>THIS IS MY VOW TO YOU</i></p>
  <p class="line">Your deaths will not be in vain. No more will I stand idly by as others take the fall in my place. When all is said and done? I WILL remember you.</p>
