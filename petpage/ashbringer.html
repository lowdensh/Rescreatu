  <div class="verse">
    <p>Life to me is precious, and this one thing I do know</p>
    <p>That in lands where evil reigns, only pure evil grows</p>
    <p>That they reap the harvest that their wickedness did sow</p>
    <p>And the dead they still do serve their overlord, you know</p>
  </div>
  <div class="verse">
    <p>I looked around my village, and it was full of life</p>
    <p>Not peaceful only, as all things, there was always strife</p>
    <p>And the thought that magic could turn husband on wife</p>
    <p>Is something so alien to me it cuts me like a knife</p>
  </div>
  <div class="verse">
    <p>For I was told, when I was born, I came in with first light</p>
    <p>And to those that raised me, they believed I had to fight</p>
    <p>Always and unendless, 'gainst the coming of the night</p>
    <p>And when the world, imperiled was, only I could end their plight</p>
  </div>
  <div class="verse">
    <p>And so when story trickled in, of evil to the north</p>
    <p>And armies led by undead dread, my life had found its course</p>
    <p>And with my brave companions, I took fast to horse</p>
    <p>To live or die, and mayhaps free, those under evil's scourge</p>
  </div>
  <div class="verse">
    <p>I don't know if to death I go, though even if I did</p>
    <p>I feel that I would always go, to maybe darkness rid</p>
    <p>From ice trapped lands that never knew the evil that was bid</p>
    <p>Upon their ground, and people too, at least so it is said</p>
  </div>
  <div class="verse">
    <p>And maybe this has never been, as it was told to me</p>
    <p>My fast, unyielding fate to go, this thing called destiny</p>
    <p>And yet, if you were in my place, would you ever flee</p>
    <p>If in your fleeing you deny, their chances to be free?</p>
